 * {@link ObjectReaderFunction}.

 * The type of the object output stream is based on the context of the object writing. Most likely will be
 * {@link ObjectOutput} or similar classes.

 * @param <OUT>
 *            The type of the object output.
 * @param <T>
 *            The type of the serialized object.

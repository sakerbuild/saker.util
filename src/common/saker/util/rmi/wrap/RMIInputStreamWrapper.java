/**
 * {@link RMIWrapper} implementation that transfers an {@link InputStream} by writing a {@link ByteSource} as a remote
 * object instead, and converts it back to an {@link InputStream} during reading.
 * <p>
 * The input stream will be wrapped into a {@link ByteSource}, and that will be written as a remote object to the other
 * endpoint. <br>
 * The remote {@link ByteSource} will be read, and converted back to an {@link InputStream}.
 * <p>
 * Writing the resulting {@link InputStream} back to the original endpoint will not return the original
 * {@link InputStream} instance to it, but a stream that is forwarded through the remote endpoint. This will probably
 * heavily degrade the performance, so if this scenario is possible to happen, users should choose a different
 * transferring mechanism.

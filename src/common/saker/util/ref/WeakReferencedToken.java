/**
 * {@link Token} implementation that is initialized with a {@linkplain WeakReference weak} and a strong reference.
 * <p>
 * This base token implementation can be used when the server stores the passed objects using a reference, and the token
 * is returned to the client to store.
 * <p>
 * The weak reference used during the construction of the object should be stored in a collection on the server, and an
 * instance of this token should be returned to the client. Once the client releases all references to this token, the
 * server will be able to garbage collect the strongly referenced object, as there are only weak references pointing to
 * it.
 * <p>
 * It may be useful to extend this class and provide additional functions to the client to manually uninstall the token
 * reference from the server.
 * 
 * @param <T>
 *            The type of the referenced object.
